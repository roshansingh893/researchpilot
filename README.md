# ResearchPilot

ResearchPilot is a production-grade generative AI project for research assistance. It combines a FastAPI backend, a Gradio UI, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and multi-agent orchestration to help users explore and synthesize information from uploaded documents.

This repository is complete and fully production-ready (**Final Phase**). ResearchPilot is an agentic research assistant powered by LangGraph. `POST /chat` provides conversational RAG with session memory, and the new `POST /research` endpoint runs a multi-step agentic workflow: planning → retrieval → analysis → report writing, with conditional routing and retry loops. It includes a complete Dockerized setup and is ready for one-click deployment on Render.

## Proposed Architecture

ResearchPilot follows a layered architecture that separates HTTP routing, business logic, AI agents, and persistence:

Example for a non-default API host or port:

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:FASTAPI_BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"

# macOS / Linux
export FASTAPI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Running FastAPI

Start the API **first** — Gradio depends on it for the integration test.

From the project root:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The server listens at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

Verify the health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "project": "ResearchPilot"
}
```

Verify the hello endpoint:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello?name=Roshan"
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello Roshan, welcome to ResearchPilot."
}
```

Interactive API docs are available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

### Running Gradio

In a **second terminal**, from the project root:

```bash
python gradio_app/app.py
```

Open the URL printed in the terminal (default: [http://127.0.0.1:7860](http://127.0.0.1:7860)).

Gradio does not embed FastAPI — it sends HTTP requests to the API process using `FASTAPI_BASE_URL` (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)). Ensure FastAPI is running before testing the connection.

### Testing the Integration

Use two terminals so FastAPI and Gradio stay separate processes:

| Terminal | Command |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` |
| 2 | `python gradio_app/app.py` |

**Verification flow:**

```
Gradio UI
    ↓
User enters name (e.g. Roshan)
    ↓
Click "Test FastAPI Connection"
    ↓
HTTP GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello?name=Roshan
    ↓
FastAPI returns JSON
    ↓
Gradio displays: "Hello Roshan, welcome to ResearchPilot."
```

**Steps:**

1. Start FastAPI in terminal 1 and confirm `/health` returns `"status": "healthy"`.
2. Start Gradio in terminal 2 and open the local URL in your browser.
3. Enter a name in **Enter your name**.
4. Click **Test FastAPI Connection**.
5. Confirm the **Response** textbox shows `Hello <name>, welcome to ResearchPilot.`

**Optional API-only check (without Gradio):**

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello?name=Roshan"
```

**Troubleshooting:**

- If Gradio shows a connection error, ensure FastAPI is running and reachable at `FASTAPI_BASE_URL` (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).
- If you changed the API host or port, set `FASTAPI_BASE_URL` to match before starting Gradio.

## Persistence (Phase 3)

ResearchPilot uses **SQLAlchemy** with **SQLite** for development persistence. Metadata is stored in a local database file so document records and conversation history survive API restarts.

| Item | Location |
|------|----------|
| Database file | `data/researchpilot.db` |
| Engine config | `app/database/session.py` |
| ORM models | `app/models/` |
| API schemas | `app/schemas/` |
| HTTP routes | `app/routers/documents.py`, `app/routers/sessions.py` |

Tables are created automatically when FastAPI starts (`init_db()` runs on application startup). The SQLite file is git-ignored; only the `data/` directory structure is tracked.

### Inspecting the Database

Using the SQLite CLI from the project root:

```bash
sqlite3 data/researchpilot.db
```

Useful commands inside the SQLite prompt:

```sql
.tables
.schema documents
.schema chat_sessions
.schema messages
SELECT * FROM documents;
SELECT * FROM chat_sessions;
SELECT * FROM messages;
.quit
```

On Windows, install [SQLite tools](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) or use a GUI such as DB Browser for SQLite.

### Example API Requests

**Create a document record:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/documents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"filename\": \"paper.pdf\"}"
```

**List documents:**

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/documents
```

**Create a chat session:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/sessions
```

**List sessions:**

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/sessions
```

### Verify with Swagger UI

1. Start FastAPI: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
2. Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
3. Under **Documents**, expand `POST /documents` → **Try it out** → set body to `{"filename": "paper.pdf"}` → **Execute** → confirm `201` and a JSON response with `id`, `filename`, and `uploaded_at`
4. Expand `GET /documents` → **Execute** → confirm the created document appears in the list
5. Under **Sessions**, expand `POST /sessions` → **Execute** → confirm `201` with `session_id` and `title`
6. Expand `GET /sessions` → **Execute** → confirm the session appears
7. Restart the API and repeat `GET /documents` and `GET /sessions` to confirm data persists across restarts
8. Optionally run `sqlite3 data/researchpilot.db "SELECT * FROM chat_sessions;"` to inspect rows directly

## Document Ingestion (Phase 4)

Phase 4 transforms uploaded PDFs into structured, metadata-rich text chunks stored in SQLite. This prepares ResearchPilot for embedding generation and retrieval in Phase 5 without implementing vector search yet.

### Upload Workflow

```
Upload PDF (POST /documents/upload)
    ↓
File saved to data/uploads/{document_id}_{filename}
    ↓
PyPDFLoader extracts LangChain Documents (one per page)
    ↓
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter creates smaller chunks
    ↓
Chunks persisted in SQLite (chunks table)
    ↓
Chunks retrievable via GET /documents/{document_id}/chunks
```

| Step | Component | Location |
|------|-----------|----------|
| HTTP upload | `POST /documents/upload` | `app/routers/documents.py` |
| File storage | Saved PDFs | `data/uploads/` |
| Loading | `PyPDFLoader` | `app/services/ingestion.py` |
| Chunking | `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` | `app/services/ingestion.py` |
| Persistence | `Document` → `Chunk` (one-to-many) | `app/models/` |

### Chunking Strategy

`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` breaks page-level text into smaller fragments using a hierarchy of separators (paragraph breaks, line breaks, sentences, words). This keeps chunks semantically coherent rather than splitting at arbitrary character positions.

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `CHUNK_SIZE` | `1000` | Target maximum characters per chunk |
| `CHUNK_OVERLAP` | `200` | Shared characters between adjacent chunks to preserve context at boundaries |

Both values are configurable via environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).

### Why Metadata Preservation Matters

Each LangChain `Document` carries `page_content` plus a `metadata` dictionary. `PyPDFLoader` populates:

- **`source`** — file path on disk
- **`page`** — zero-based page index

ResearchPilot adds **`source_filename`** during loading and maps metadata into the `Chunk` model:

| Chunk field | Source |
|-------------|--------|
| `chunk_text` | LangChain `page_content` |
| `page_number` | Loader `page` metadata (stored as 1-based) |
| `chunk_order` | Sequential index after splitting |
| `document_id` | Foreign key to parent `Document` |

Preserving page numbers and source filenames enables **citations** in future RAG responses (e.g. "See page 3 of paper.pdf") and ensures embeddings in Phase 5 can be traced back to their origin.

### Why LangChain Documents?

LangChain `Document` objects are the standard interchange format across loaders, splitters, embedders, and retrievers. By ingesting PDFs into Documents and splitting them with LangChain splitters, ResearchPilot stays compatible with the ecosystem used in Phase 5 (embeddings + retrieval) without re-parsing PDFs or inventing a parallel data model.

### Why Embeddings Are Deferred to Phase 5

Phase 4 focuses on **correct ingestion and chunk storage**. Embeddings require model selection, API keys, and vector index management — concerns that belong in the retrieval layer. Storing clean, metadata-rich chunks now means Phase 5 can embed and index them without revisiting the ingestion pipeline.

### Example API Requests

**Upload a PDF:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/documents/upload \
  -F "file=@paper.pdf"
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "filename": "paper.pdf",
  "uploaded_at": "2026-06-14T12:00:00",
  "chunk_count": 42
}
```

**List chunks for a document:**

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/documents/1/chunks
```

**Inspect chunks in SQLite:**

```sql
SELECT id, document_id, page_number, chunk_order, substr(chunk_text, 1, 80)
FROM chunks
WHERE document_id = 1
ORDER BY chunk_order;
```

### Verify with Swagger UI (Phase 4)

1. Start FastAPI: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
2. Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
3. Under **Documents**, expand `POST /documents/upload` → **Try it out**
4. Click **Choose File**, select a PDF, then **Execute**
5. Confirm `201` response with `id`, `filename`, `uploaded_at`, and `chunk_count`
6. Expand `GET /documents/{document_id}/chunks` → enter the `id` from step 5 → **Execute**
7. Confirm a JSON array of chunks with `chunk_text`, `page_number`, and `chunk_order`
8. Verify the file exists under `data/uploads/` and rows appear in SQLite:

```bash
sqlite3 data/researchpilot.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chunks WHERE document_id = 1;"
```

## Semantic Retrieval (Phase 5)

Phase 5 adds **embeddings** and **vector similarity search** so ResearchPilot can find the most relevant document chunks for a natural-language query — without generating LLM answers yet.

### What Are Embeddings?

An **embedding** is a dense numerical vector that represents the semantic meaning of text. Similar concepts produce vectors that are close together in vector space, even when the exact words differ. ResearchPilot generates embeddings for each chunk during upload and for each query at retrieval time.

### Why Vector Databases?

SQLite excels at structured relational data (documents, chunks, conversations) but is not optimized for similarity search across high-dimensional vectors. **ChromaDB** stores embeddings and finds nearest neighbors efficiently using approximate nearest-neighbor indexes (HNSW).

### SQLite vs ChromaDB

| Store | Role | Contents |
|-------|------|----------|
| **SQLite** (`data/researchpilot.db`) | Source of truth for metadata | Documents, chunk text, page numbers, timestamps |
| **ChromaDB** (`data/chroma_db/`) | Vector index | Embeddings + retrieval metadata (`chunk_id`, `document_id`, `page_number`, `source_filename`) |

Each Chroma entry uses the SQLite `chunk.id` as its vector id, maintaining a direct mapping between stores.

### Dynamic Collection Naming (Removing Fixed Size Dependency)

A standard challenge in vector databases is that collections are configured with a fixed vector dimension matching the embedding model's output size (e.g., `1536` for OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` or `384` for local sentence-transformer models). If the embedding provider or model changes, ChromaDB raises dimensionality mismatch errors when querying or indexing the existing collection.

To eliminate this fixed-size dependency, ResearchPilot dynamically derives the ChromaDB collection name at runtime using the active model's output dimension:
`{base}_{dim}d` (e.g., `researchpilot_chunks_384d` or `researchpilot_chunks_1536d`).

**Benefits of this approach:**
- **Zero Configuration Conflicts:** Swapping embedding providers (e.g., switching `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` in `.env` from `openai` to `huggingface`) automatically routes all vector queries and storage requests to the corresponding collection of the correct dimension.
- **Safety and Isolation:** Older collections with different vector configurations remain intact on disk under `data/chroma_db/`. You can safely query both alternately, or manually delete unused directories when deprecating older models.

### End-to-End Workflow

```
Upload PDF (POST /documents/upload)
    ↓
Chunks saved in SQLite (Phase 4)
    ↓
Embeddings generated (OpenAI by default)
    ↓
Vectors stored in ChromaDB with metadata
    ↓
POST /retrieve { "query": "..." }
    ↓
Query embedded → similarity search → top-k chunks returned
```

### How Retrieval Works

1. The query text is embedded using the configured provider.
2. ChromaDB performs cosine similarity search against indexed chunk vectors.
3. Top-k matches are joined with SQLite for authoritative `chunk_text` and document metadata.
4. Results include a `similarity_score` (1.0 = identical direction, lower = less similar).

### Embedding Provider Design

`app/services/embedding_service.py` exposes a factory (`get_embedding_model`) that returns a LangChain `Embeddings` instance based on `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`:

| Provider | Status | Integration path |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| `openai` | Supported | `OpenAIEmbeddings` via `langchain-openai` |
| `gemini` | Future | `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` from `langchain-google-genai` (not installed) |
| `ollama` | Future | `OllamaEmbeddings` from `langchain-ollama` |
| `huggingface` | Future | `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` from `langchain-huggingface` |

Swapping providers requires a new factory branch and the corresponding LangChain integration package — ingestion and retrieval code stay unchanged.

### Why LLM Generation Is Deferred to Phase 6

Phase 5 delivers **retrieval only**: finding relevant chunks. Phase 6 will add conversation memory and answer synthesis by passing retrieved context to an LLM. Separating retrieval from generation keeps each phase testable and avoids premature prompt engineering.

### Example API Requests

**Retrieve relevant chunks:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/retrieve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"query\": \"What is positional encoding?\"}"
```

Expected response:

```json
[
  {
    "chunk_id": 17,
    "document_id": 2,
    "page_number": 7,
    "source_filename": "attention.pdf",
    "similarity_score": 0.92,
    "chunk_text": "Positional encoding injects order information..."
  }
]
```

### Verify with Swagger UI (Phase 5)

1. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment (or use `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=test` for offline testing).
2. Start FastAPI: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
3. Upload a PDF via `POST /documents/upload` and note the returned `id`
4. Optionally confirm chunks via `GET /documents/{document_id}/chunks`
5. Expand `POST /retrieve` → **Try it out** → set body to `{"query": "What is positional encoding?"}` → **Execute**
6. Confirm a JSON array of matching chunks with `similarity_score` and metadata
7. Restart the API and repeat `POST /retrieve` to confirm ChromaDB persistence under `data/chroma_db/`

### Run Automated Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

Tests use `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=test` and `LLM_PROVIDER=test` with isolated temporary SQLite and ChromaDB directories. Coverage includes retrieval, RAG chat, citations, empty-context handling, and provider abstraction.

## RAG Answer Generation (Phase 6)

Phase 6 completes the RAG loop by **generating grounded answers** from retrieved document chunks. ResearchPilot still does not implement conversation memory, agents, or streaming.

### What Is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines two steps:

1. **Retrieval** — find relevant evidence in your document index
2. **Generation** — an LLM synthesizes an answer using only that evidence

This grounds responses in uploaded documents rather than the model's parametric memory alone.

### Retrieval vs Generation

| Layer | Responsibility | Component |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **Retrieval** | Find top-k similar chunks | `retrieval_service.py` (unchanged) |
| **Prompt** | Constrain the LLM to context | `prompt_builder.py` |
| **Generation** | Produce natural-language answer | `llm_service.py` |
| **Orchestration** | Wire the pipeline + citations | `rag_service.py` |

The router (`POST /chat`) delegates entirely to `rag_service.py` — no business logic in the HTTP layer.

### Prompt Grounding Strategy

`prompt_builder.py` constructs a template that:

- Identifies the assistant role
- Instructs **answer only from context**
- Provides an explicit refusal phrase when context is insufficient
- Labels each chunk with `filename` and `page_number`

```
You are a research assistant.
Answer ONLY using the provided context.
...
Context:
[1] (attention.pdf, page 7):
Positional encoding injects order information...
Question: What is positional encoding?
Answer:
```

### Hallucination Prevention

When retrieval returns **no meaningful context**, the RAG service:

- **Skips the LLM call entirely**
- Returns: `"I could not find sufficient information in the uploaded documents."`
- Returns `"sources": []`

This avoids prompting an LLM without evidence — a common source of hallucination.

### Citation Workflow

After generation, `build_citations()` deduplicates sources by `(filename, page_number)` using metadata already stored during ingestion and indexing:

```json
{
  "answer": "Positional encoding injects order information...",
  "sources": [
    { "filename": "attention.pdf", "page_number": 7 }
  ]
}
```

### LLM Provider Abstraction

`llm_service.py` exposes a provider factory (`get_llm_service`) returning an `LLMService` with a single `generate(prompt)` method:

| Provider | Status | Integration path |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| `groq` | Supported (default) | `ChatGroq` via `langchain-groq` |
| `openai` | Supported | `ChatOpenAI` via `langchain-openai` |
| `ollama` | Future | `ChatOllama` from `langchain-ollama` |
| `test` | Tests only | Deterministic stub (no API calls) |

Swapping providers requires setting `LLM_PROVIDER` in `.env` — RAG and retrieval code remain unchanged.

### End-to-End Workflow

```
Upload PDF → chunk → embed → ChromaDB
    ↓
POST /chat { "question": "..." }
    ↓
retrieve_chunks() — reuse Phase 5 retrieval
    ↓
build_rag_prompt() — grounded prompt
    ↓
generate_answer() — LLM provider
    ↓
build_citations() — deduplicated sources
    ↓
{ "answer": "...", "sources": [...] }
```

### Example API Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"session_id\": 1, \"question\": \"What is positional encoding?\"}"
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "answer": "Positional encoding injects order information into transformer inputs.",
  "sources": [
    { "filename": "attention.pdf", "page_number": 1 }
  ]
}
```

### Verify with Swagger UI (Phase 6)

1. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` (tests use `LLM_PROVIDER=test`)
2. Start FastAPI: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
3. Upload a PDF via `POST /documents/upload`
4. Create a session via `POST /sessions` and note the `session_id`
5. Expand `POST /chat` → **Try it out** → `{"session_id": 1, "question": "What is positional encoding?"}` → **Execute**
6. Confirm `answer` and `sources` with filename and page numbers
7. Call `/chat` before uploading any documents → confirm empty-context fallback

### Run Automated Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

## Conversational Memory (Phase 7)

Phase 7 transforms ResearchPilot from a stateless RAG system into a **conversational AI assistant** with session-aware memory.

### Why Conversational Memory Matters

Without memory, each question is independent — the assistant cannot resolve references like "it", "they", or "that technique". Real research conversations are inherently multi-turn: users build on previous answers, ask follow-ups, and use pronouns to reference earlier topics.

### Retrieval Memory vs Conversation Memory

| Type | Purpose | Store |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Retrieval memory** | Find relevant document chunks for a query | ChromaDB (vector search) |
| **Conversation memory** | Track what was discussed in this session | SQLite (`messages` table) |

Both are used together: conversation history provides context for pronoun resolution, while retrieval provides evidence for grounded answers.

### Memory Window Strategy

Sending the entire conversation history to the LLM would quickly exceed token limits and increase latency. ResearchPilot uses a **sliding window** of the last N user-assistant exchanges (configurable via `MEMORY_WINDOW`, default 5).

```
Window = 5 → last 5 pairs (10 messages) included in prompt
Older messages are persisted but not sent to the LLM
```

This balances context quality with token budget — recent exchanges are the most relevant for resolving references.

### Session Management Architecture

```
POST /sessions          → Create a new chat session
GET  /sessions          → List all sessions
GET  /sessions/{id}/messages → Get all messages in a session
DELETE /sessions/{id}   → Delete session + cascade messages
POST /chat              → Conversational RAG (requires session_id)
```

### Database Relationships

```
ChatSession (chat_sessions)
├── id, title, created_at, updated_at
└── messages: [Message, ...] (one-to-many, cascade delete)

Message (messages)
├── id, session_id (FK), role, content, created_at
└── session: ChatSession (back-reference)
```

### Conversational RAG Pipeline

```
User Question
    ↓
Retrieve Relevant Chunks (ChromaDB)
    ↓
Fetch Recent History (last N exchanges)
    ↓
Build Conversational Prompt
    (history + context + question)
    ↓
LLM Generation
    ↓
Persist User Message + Assistant Message
    ↓
Return Answer with Citations
```

### Example Multi-Turn Conversation

```
# Create a session
POST /sessions → { "session_id": 1, "title": "New Chat" }

# Turn 1
POST /chat { "session_id": 1, "question": "What is self-attention?" }
→ "Self-attention computes weighted relationships between tokens..."

# Turn 2 — pronoun reference resolved via session history
POST /chat { "session_id": 1, "question": "What are its limitations?" }
→ "The limitations of self-attention include quadratic complexity..."
    ↑ "its" resolved to "self-attention" from conversation history

# Turn 3
POST /chat { "session_id": 1, "question": "How do transformers address this?" }
→ Uses history of both previous turns for context
```

### Verify with Swagger UI (Phase 7)

1. Start FastAPI: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
2. `POST /sessions` → note the `session_id`
3. `POST /chat` with `{"session_id": 1, "question": "What is self-attention?"}` → confirm answer
4. `POST /chat` with `{"session_id": 1, "question": "What are its limitations?"}` → confirm the answer references self-attention (pronoun resolved)
5. `GET /sessions/1/messages` → confirm 4 messages (2 user + 2 assistant)
6. Create a second session and chat in it → verify session 1 messages are unaffected
7. `DELETE /sessions/1` → verify cascade deletion
8. Restart the server → verify `GET /sessions` still returns session 2 (persistence)

## Agentic Research Assistant (Phase 8)

Phase 8 transforms ResearchPilot from a linear RAG pipeline into an **agentic research assistant** using **LangGraph** for state management, conditional routing, and retry logic.

### What Is an Agent?

An **AI agent** is a system that uses an LLM to reason about tasks, make decisions, and execute multi-step workflows autonomously. Unlike a simple chatbot that takes a question and produces an answer in a single step, an agent:

- **Plans** what steps are needed
- **Executes** each step, observing results
- **Decides** what to do next based on outcomes
- **Adapts** when things go wrong (e.g., retries)

### RAG vs Agentic RAG

| Aspect | Traditional RAG | Agentic RAG |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Flow** | Linear: retrieve → generate | Multi-step: plan → retrieve → analyze → write |
| **Decision-making** | None — always follows same path | Conditional routing based on results |
| **Error handling** | Fails or returns empty | Retries with backoff, falls back gracefully |
| **Query handling** | Takes query as-is | Decomposes complex queries into sub-tasks |
| **Output** | Single answer string | Structured report with findings |
| **State** | Stateless per request | Managed state throughout pipeline |

### What Is LangGraph?

**LangGraph** is a library for building stateful, multi-step LLM workflows as directed graphs. Each node is a function that reads and writes to a shared state object. Edges (including conditional edges) determine the execution order.

Key concepts:

- **StateGraph** — defines the graph structure and state schema
- **Nodes** — functions that process and update state
- **Edges** — connections between nodes (unconditional or conditional)
- **Conditional edges** — routing functions that inspect state and choose the next node
- **Compiled graph** — the executable form, invoked with an initial state

### State Management

`ResearchState` is a `TypedDict` that serves as the **single source of truth** for the entire workflow. Every node reads from and writes to this shared state:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `query` | `str` | Original user question |
| `plan` | `list[str]` | Sub-tasks from the planner |
| `current_task` | `str` | Sub-task being processed |
| `retrieved_chunks` | `list[dict]` | Aggregated retrieval results |
| `findings` | `list[str]` | Structured findings from analyzer |
| `report` | `str` | Final research report |
| `sources` | `list[dict]` | Deduplicated citation metadata |
| `retry_count` | `int` | Number of retries performed (max 3) |
| `average_similarity` | `float` | Relevance score of retrieved chunks |
| `status` | `str` | Current execution phase |

### Conditional Routing

Two conditional edges control the graph flow based on state:

**`check_retrieval`** (after retriever):
- Chunks found + good relevance → proceed to analyzer
- Chunks found + low relevance → skip to insufficient context (graceful fallback)
- Chunks empty + retries remain → retry retrieval
- Chunks empty + max retries reached → skip to report writer

**`check_findings`** (after analyzer):
- Findings present → proceed to report writer
- Findings empty + retries remain → retry retrieval
- Findings empty + max retries reached → generate partial report

### Retry Loops

When retrieval yields no results, the graph retries up to **3 times** via a dedicated `retry_retrieval` node that increments `retry_count`. This prevents infinite loops while giving the system multiple chances to find evidence.

After exhausting retries, the graph proceeds to the report writer with whatever partial data is available, ensuring the user always gets a response.

### Research Workflow

### New `/research` Endpoint

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/research \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"query\": \"Compare CNN, RNN and Transformers for NLP.\"}"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "summary": "Executive Summary\nThis report compares CNN, RNN, and Transformer architectures...\n\nDetailed Findings\n...\n\nConclusion\n...",
  "key_findings": [
    "CNNs excel at spatial feature extraction using convolutional filters",
    "RNNs process sequential data through recurrent connections",
    "Transformers use self-attention for parallel sequence processing",
    "Transformers have largely replaced RNNs for NLP tasks"
  ],
  "sources": [
    { "filename": "architectures.pdf", "page_number": 1 },
    { "filename": "architectures.pdf", "page_number": 2 }
  ]
}
```

### Verify with Swagger UI (Phase 8)

1. Start FastAPI: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
2. Upload PDFs via `POST /documents/upload`
3. Expand `POST /research` → **Try it out** → set body to `{"query": "Compare CNN, RNN and Transformers for NLP."}` → **Execute**
4. Confirm `summary`, `key_findings`, and `sources` in the response
5. Verify `POST /chat` still works exactly as before

### Run Automated Tests

```bash
pytest tests/test_research.py -v
```

Tests cover: planner decomposition, retriever aggregation, conditional routing, retry logic, analyzer, report generation, end-to-end graph execution, API endpoint, partial results, source deduplication, and existing `/chat` regression.

## Deployment & Production (Final Phase)

The final phase transforms ResearchPilot from a local development project into a production-ready application using Docker and Render.

### Unified Architecture

To comply with free-tier limitations on cloud providers (which often allow only one web service), the **Gradio UI is mounted directly onto the FastAPI backend** (`app/main.py`). This means both the API and the user interface are served from a single container on the same port.

- `GET /` → Serves the Gradio User Interface
- `GET /health` → Deep health check verifying database and ChromaDB connections
- `POST /chat`, `POST /research`, etc. → Standard FastAPI routes

### Dockerization

A multi-stage, production-optimized `Dockerfile` is included:
- **Base image:** `python:3.11-slim` for reduced attack surface and size.
- **Dependency Caching:** Uses `--mount=type=cache` to speed up builds.
- **Security:** Runs as a non-root user (`appuser`).
- **Web Server:** Uses `uvicorn` configured for production.

### Render Deployment

The repository includes a `render.yaml` file for one-click deployment as an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) blueprint.

**Key Render configurations:**
- **Persistent Disk:** A 1GB disk is mounted at `/app/data`. This is critical because Render spins down free-tier instances, and without a disk, all SQLite metadata and ChromaDB vectors would be permanently lost on every restart.
- **Secure Secrets:** API keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`) are marked as `sync: false`, preventing them from being exposed in source control.
- **Health Checks:** Configured with `healthCheckPath: /health` so the load balancer knows when the app is ready to receive traffic.

**How to deploy:**
1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Connect your GitHub account to Render.
3. Choose **Blueprints** and select this repository. Render will automatically parse the `render.yaml` and provision the Web Service and Persistent Disk.
4. Add your API keys manually in the Render dashboard.
